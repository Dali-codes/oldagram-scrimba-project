#  Oldagram - scrimba project

### In this project the focus was on:
- creating the first post with the provided information and images
- semantic HTML
- adding hover on like icon


### I have continued with these stretch goals:
- using JavaScript to render all three posts
- increasing the like when clicking on the like icon


### With more practice I would like to add:
- localStorage
- animation when clicked on the like icon
- increasing likes on double click
- input fields to add comments
